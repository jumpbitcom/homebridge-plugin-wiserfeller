# Homebridge Platform Plugin Wiser equipment

</span>

## Purpose
This plugin provides a bridge to Apple HomeKit covering Wiser by Feller AG devices. With a full Homebridge and this plugin you
will be able to control the devices directly in your Home app.

Further documentation of the API:
https://github.com/Feller-AG/wiser-tutorial/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file

and as OpenAPI documentation:

### Setup Development Environment

To develop Homebridge plugins you must have Node.js 18 or later installed, and a modern code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This plugin template uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make development easier and comes with pre-configured settings for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and ESLint. If you are using VS Code install these extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

### Install Development Dependencies

Using a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run this command to install the development dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

### Build Plugin

TypeScript needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run. The following command will compile the contents of your [`src`](./src) directory and put the resulting code into the `dist` folder.

```shell
npm run build
```

### Link To Homebridge

Run this command so your global installation of Homebridge can discover the plugin in your development environment:

```shell
npm link
```

You can now start Homebridge, use the `-D` flag, so you can see debug log messages in your plugin:

```shell
homebridge -D
```

### Watch For Changes and Build Automatically

If you want to have your code compile automatically as you make changes, and restart Homebridge automatically between changes, you first need to add your plugin as a platform in `./test/hbConfig/config.json`:
```
{
...
    "platforms": [
        {
            "name": "Config",
            "port": 8581,
            "platform": "config"
        },
        {
            "name": "<PLUGIN_NAME>",
            //... any other options, as listed in config.schema.json ...
            "platform": "<PLATFORM_NAME>"
        }
    ]
}
```

and then you can run:

```shell
npm run watch
```

This will launch an instance of Homebridge in debug mode which will restart every time you make a change to the source code. It will load the config stored in the default location under `~/.homebridge`. You may need to stop other running instances of Homebridge while using this command to prevent conflicts. You can adjust the Homebridge startup command in the [`nodemon.json`](./nodemon.json) file.

## Wiser API tests
Use the [RESTful API Test](/rest-api.http) within VS Code to work directly with the plain API. Set the environment $WISERIP and $WISERTOKEN to get it working within your local area network.


## Docker Container
There is a dockerfile which creates a custom docker image with additional ports. The plugin bridge port needs to be aligned with the port set in your bridge config.json.
